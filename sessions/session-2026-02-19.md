# Session – 2026-02-19

## Topics covered
- In this session I learned about tables, which is a structure of data. All tables must have a primary key, that is a unique value for a row record in a table. If you want to reference another table from a table, we use a foreign key. I also remembered abou the join function on sql, and the inner, left adn right join, which give us (thinnking about a venn diagram) the overlapping part, and the left and right part of the circles respectively (in case of the last two, whenever it finds a record without a match it will return it as null). Cross join (never use). Finally we learned about joining the same table to itself

## What I understood
- Thanks to this I refresh my memory on what are tables, primary keys, foreign keys, the inner join, and joining the same table to itself

## What is still confusing
- What is still confunsing is the left and right join

## Questions
- I have no questions, I just need to study a bit more about the joins
